"According to Wikipedia , Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is eleven times that of Earth, and a tenth that of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm), with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky, after the Moon and Venus, and has been observed since prehistoric times. Its name derives from that of Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.","source: wikipedia , name:jupiter , fifth planet from sun , largest planet in solar system , mass: 2.5times of all other planets etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"According to Wikipedia , Greek (Modern Greek: Ελληνικά, romanized: Elliniká, pronounced [eliniˈka]; Ancient Greek: Ἑλληνική, romanized: Hellēnikḗ) is an Indo-European language, constituting an independent branch of Indo-European. It is native to Greece, Cyprus, Italy (in Calabria and Salento), southern Albania, and other regions of the Balkans, Caucasus, the Black Sea coast, Asia Minor, and the Eastern Mediterranean. It has the longest documented history of any Indo-European language, spanning at least 3,400 years of written records.[10] Its writing system is the Greek alphabet, which has been used for approximately 2,800 years;[11][12] previously, Greek was recorded in writing systems such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary.[13] The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Coptic, Gothic, and many other writing systems.
The Greek language holds a very important place in the history of the Western world. Beginning with the epics of Homer, ancient Greek literature includes many works of lasting importance in the European canon. Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science and philosophy were originally composed. The New Testament of the Christian Bible was also originally written in Greek.[14][15] Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world, the Greek texts and Greek societies of antiquity constitute the objects of study of the discipline of Classics.
During antiquity, Greek was by far the most widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world.[16] It eventually became the official language of the Byzantine Empire and developed into Medieval Greek.[17] In its modern form, Greek is the official language of Greece and Cyprus and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. It is spoken by at least 13.5 million people today in Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Albania, Turkey, and the many other countries of the Greek diaspora.

"According toWikipedia , Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer who plays Test and ODI cricket for the Indian national team. A former captain in all formats of the game, Kohli retired from the T20I format following India's win at the 2024 T20 World Cup. He's a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm medium bowler. Kohli holds the highest IPL run-scorer record, ranks second in T20I, third in ODI, and stands the fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] Regarded as one of the greatest batsman of all time,he also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and is second in the list of most international centuries scored.[5]
Kohli was a member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.[6] He represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League and Delhi in domestic cricket.
In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit of T20I rankings.[7] In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.[8]
Kohli has garnered 10 ICC Awards which is the most decorated player in International Cricket history. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year award four times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to win both ICC ODI and Test Player of the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. Kohli has the second most and most 'Player of the Match' and 'Player of the Series' awards to his name, respectively, in all three formats combined. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna Award, in 2018. In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

"According to Wikipedia , India, officially the Republic of India,[j][21] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country in the world by area and the most populous country. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[k] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.
Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[23][24][25] Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[26] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[27] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[28][29] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[30] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[31] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[32] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[33] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[34] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[35] but also marked by the declining status of women,[36] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[l][37] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[38]
In the early mediaeval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts.[39] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[40] eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of mediaeval Islam.[41] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[42] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[43] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[44] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[m][45] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy but also consolidating its sovereignty.[46] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[47][48] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and public life took root.[49] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[50][51] In 1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[52][53][54][55] a Hindu-majority dominion of India and a Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[56]India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system, and has been the world's most populous democracy since the time of its independence in 1947.[57][58][59] It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually in 1951 to US$2,601 in 2022, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. During the same time, its population grew from 361 million to almost 1.4 billion,[60] and India became the most populous country in 2023.[61][62] From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[63] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[64] India has a space programme with several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[65] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[66] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air pollution.[69] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[70] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[71] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[72] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.","source: Wikipedia, name: India, official name: Republic of India, location: South Asia, geographical size: seventh-largest by area, population: most populous country, borders: Pakistan (west), China, Nepal, Bhutan (north), Bangladesh, Myanmar (east); Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, island neighbors: Sri Lanka, Maldives, ancient human arrival: 55,000 years ago, early civilization: Indus Valley (9,000 years ago), historical languages: Sanskrit, Dravidian languages, religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism; later Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, empires: Maurya, Gupta, Delhi Sultanate, Vijayanagara, Mughal, British colonial rule, independence: 1947 (partition into India and Pakistan), republic: 1950, economic growth: nominal per capita income (US$64 in 1951 to US$2,601 in 2022), population growth: 361 million (1951) to almost 1.4 billion, global influence: information technology, cinema, spirituality, space program: active with planned missions, poverty: reduction with rising economic inequality, military: nuclear-armed, high defense spending, disputes: Kashmir (with Pakistan and China), socio-economic challenges: gender inequality, child malnutrition, air pollution, biodiversity: megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots, forest cover: 21.7%, wildlife: supported in forests and protected habitats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to Britannica, Mount Everest, mountain on the crest of the Great Himalayas of southern Asia that lies on the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, at 27°59′ N 86°56′ E. Reaching an elevation of 29,032 feet (8,849 meters), Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world.Like other high peaks in the region, Mount Everest has long been revered by local peoples. Its most common Tibetan name, Chomolungma, means “Goddess Mother of the World” or “Goddess of the Valley.” The Sanskrit name Sagarmatha means literally “Peak of Heaven.” Its identity as the highest point on the Earth’s surface was not recognized, however, until 1852, when the governmental Survey of India established that fact. In 1865 the mountain—previously referred to as Peak XV—was renamed for Sir George Everest, British surveyor general of India from 1830 to 1843. According to etymological sources, the mountain’s Western name is often mispronounced “Ever-est” or “Ev-rest,” despite the pronunciation of Sir George Everest’s surname being “EVE-rest.”The Himalayan ranges were thrust upward by tectonic action as the Indian-Australian Plate moved northward from the south and was subducted (forced downward) under the Eurasian Plate following the collision of the two plates between about 40 and 50 million years ago. The Himalayas themselves started rising about 25 to 30 million years ago, and the Great Himalayas began to take their present form during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago). Everest and its surrounding peaks are part of a large mountain massif that forms a focal point, or knot, of this tectonic action in the Great Himalayas. Information from global positioning instruments in place on Everest since the late 1990s indicates that the mountain continues to move a few inches to the northeast and rise a fraction of an inch each year. 
According to etymological sources, the mountain’s Western name is often mispronounced “Ever-est” or “Ev-rest,” despite the pronunciation of Sir George Everest’s surname being “EVE-rest.”
Everest is composed of multiple layers of rock folded back on themselves (nappes). Rock on the lower elevations of the mountain consists of metamorphic schists and gneisses, topped by igneous granites. Higher up are found sedimentary rocks of marine origin (remnants of the ancient floor of the Tethys Sea that closed after the collision of the two plates). Notable is the Yellow Band, a limestone formation that is prominently visible just below the summit pyramid. The barren Southeast, Northeast, and West ridges culminate in the Everest summit; a short distance away is the South Summit, a minor bump on the Southeast Ridge with an elevation of 28,700 feet (8,748 meters). The mountain can be seen directly from its northeastern side, where it rises about 12,000 feet (3,600 meters) above the Plateau of Tibet. The peak of Changtse (24,803 feet [7,560 meters]) rises to the north. Khumbutse (21,867 feet [6,665 meters]), Nuptse (25,791 feet [7,861 meters]), and Lhotse (27,940 feet [8,516 meters]) surround Everest’s base to the west and south.","source: Britannica, name: Mount Everest, location: Great Himalayas, border of Nepal and Tibet Autonomous Region of China, coordinates: 27°59′ N 86°56′ E, height: 29,032 feet (8,849 meters), highest mountain: recognized since 1852 by the Survey of India, other names: Chomolungma (Tibetan, ""Goddess Mother of the World""), Sagarmatha (Sanskrit, ""Peak of Heaven""), Western name origin: named for Sir George Everest, British surveyor general, pronunciation: ""EVE-rest,"" often mispronounced as ""Ever-est"" or ""Ev-rest,"" formation: uplifted by tectonic activity (Indian-Australian Plate subduction under Eurasian Plate), tectonic movement: continues to shift northeast and rise annually, geological composition: lower layers - metamorphic schists and gneisses; upper layers - igneous granites and sedimentary rocks of marine origin, Yellow Band: visible limestone formation below summit, notable peaks nearby: South Summit (28,700 feet), Changtse (24,803 feet), Khumbutse (21,867 feet), Nuptse (25,791 feet), and Lhotse (27,940 feet).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to WWF , Rivers are unpredictable, and nowhere is this truer than in the Amazon River Basin, which is subject to radical seasonal changes throughout the year.Amazon rivers provide a range of habitats, including swamps, marshes and streams, each hosting different types of wildlife.1 These waterways are subject to major annual flood cycles, affecting the ecology and the landscape of the region.Coming a close second after the Nile as the world’s longest river, the Amazon River sets the record in terms of the sheer volume of water that it carries – a mind-boggling average discharge of 219,000 m3/sec of water.It is estimated that approximately one-sixth of all fresh water that drains into the world's oceans goes through the 320-km-wide delt  of the Amazon, where it meets the Atlantic Ocean.  As the seasons change, so does the river. During the dry season, the width of the Amazon River can be 4 km to 5 km in places – and in the wet season, this can increase to 50 km! At the height of the wet season, the current can reach a speed of 7 km/hr.Major roles of the Amazon RiverAs the drainage system of the Amazon Basin, the Amazon River and its approximately 1,100 tributaries play major roles in the ecology of the basin. Before roads and airstrips started appearing in the basin, these waterways were the major access routes to the interior areas of Brazil and the northern half of South America.For example, the only way you can get to Iquitos, Peru, which is right on the Amazon River, is to board a plane or a boat. There are no roads to get there.3Origins and course of the riverThe Amazon River has its source high in the Peruvian Andes, at an elevation of 5,598 m. There, at a mere 192 km from the Pacific Ocean where it once flowed into, the Amazon River begins as a small tributary called the Carhuasanta. As it heads east, it flows into and becomes the Hornillos, which merges into the Apurimac, a major tributary that eventually joins the Ene, the Tambo and then the Ucayali.After an initial drop in elevation, the Amazon River steadies its descent towards the Atlantic Ocean at a rate of 1.5 cm for every kilometre over a distance of over 6,400 km. In some places, the river reaches a width of 10 km, as far as 1,600 km upriver, and large ships can dock all the way up to Iquitos, Peru.Sighting the river before the land The brown waters of the Amazon River can be seen as far as 100 km out to sea from the mainland, well before the continent is in sight. In the early days of colonization, this phenomenon would help ships sailing from Europe to South America ensure they were on good course before sighting the land.","source: WWF, region: Amazon River Basin, characteristics: extreme seasonal changes affecting wildlife and landscape, habitats including swamps, marshes, streams, flood cycle: significant impact on basin ecology, global significance: second longest river (after the Nile), with the highest volume of water (average discharge of 219,000 m³/sec), freshwater contribution: one-sixth of global freshwater entering oceans flows through Amazon’s delta into the Atlantic Ocean, seasonal variation: width ranges from 4-5 km in the dry season to 50 km in the wet season; wet season current speed up to 7 km/hr, role: key access routes before roads and airstrips, remains the only way to access isolated regions like Iquitos, Peru, origin: Peruvian Andes, elevation 5,598 m, beginning as Carhuasanta tributary, evolving through rivers (Hornillos, Apurimac, Ene, Tambo, Ucayali),

"According to International Fund for Animal Welfare , Found in every ocean in the world, great white sharks are the largest predatory fish on Earth and sit at the top of the marine food chain. They get their name from the pearly white color of their underbellies, though their upper bodies are a slate grey color that helps them blend in with the rocky sea floor.While culturally famous thanks to the Jaws franchise, there’s a lot about this species that we don’t know, including the size of their home range, where they mate, or where females give birth. What we do know is they breathe through gills and have a highly sensitive sense of smell, able to detect a drop of blood from half a kilometer away. They are not cold-blooded; instead, great white sharks are endothermic, meaning they have a special regulatory system that keeps their body temperature slightly higher than the water around them. This allows them to live in different oceans with different climates. 
When hunting, great white sharks are stealthy and position themselves underneath their prey before swimming at high speeds towards it. If a shark is close to the surface, it may breach to grab the prey in its mouth.
Great white sharks are migratory. In the Pacific Ocean, great whites have been seen migrating between Mexico and Hawaii, and it’s possible that great whites living in other oceans migrate even further. As a top predator, the great white shark plays a very important role in maintaining balance in its ecosystem. If sharks were to be removed from their habitat, prey species’ numbers would rise and competition for food would increase to an unsustainable level. What is a great white shark's scientific name?  The great white shark’s scientific name is Carcharodon carcharias. The genus name Carcharodon comes from two Greek words, karcharos (meaning sharpen) and odous (meaning teeth). Are great white sharks endangered?  The IUCN lists the great white shark as vulnerable and its population trend as decreasing. Their numbers and ranges are very difficult to track, but we do know that they are threatened by poaching and fishing practices. 
Where do great white sharks live?  Great white sharks can be found in every ocean, but they stay away from the colder waters of Antarctica and the Arctic. They are most frequently found in temperate waters where the temperature is easy to adapt to and their favorite food is abundant","Name: Great White Shark, Largest predatory fish on Earth , Habitat: Found in every ocean,

"Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the production, transmission and application of electric power. He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor and developed AC generation and transmission technology. Though he was famous and respected, he was never able to translate his copious inventions into long-term financial success—unlike his early employer and chief rival, Thomas Edison. Nikola Tesla’s Early Years Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father was a priest in the Serbian Orthodox church and his mother managed the family’s farm. In 1863 Tesla’s brother Daniel was killed in a riding accident. The shock of the loss unsettled the 7-year-old Tesla, who reported seeing visions—the first signs of his lifelong mental illnesses. Did you know? During the 1890s Mark Twain struck up a friendship with inventor Nikola Tesla. Twain often visited him in his lab, where in 1894 Tesla photographed the great American writer in one of the first pictures ever lit by phosphorescent light. Tesla studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz and philosophy at the University of Prague. In 1882, while on a walk, he came up with the idea for a brushless AC motor, making the first sketches of its rotating electromagnets in the sand of the path. Later that year he moved to Paris and got a job repairing direct current (DC) power plants with the Continental Edison Company. Two years later he immigrated to the United States. Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison
Tesla arrived in New York in 1884 and was hired as an engineer at Thomas Edison’s Manhattan headquarters. He worked there for a year, impressing Edison with his diligence and ingenuity. At one point Edison told Tesla he would pay $50,000 for an improved design for his DC dynamos. After months of experimentation, Tesla presented a solution and asked for the money. Edison demurred, saying, “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor.” Tesla quit soon after.Nikola Tesla and Westinghouse
After an unsuccessful attempt to start his own Tesla Electric Light Company and a stint digging ditches for $2 a day, Tesla found backers to support his research into alternating current. In 1887 and 1888 he was granted more than 30 patents for his inventions and invited to address the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on his work. His lecture caught the attention of George Westinghouse, the inventor who had launched the first AC power system near Boston and was Edison’s major competitor in the “Battle of the Currents.”Westinghouse hired Tesla, licensed the patents for his AC motor and gave him his own lab. In 1890 Edison arranged for a convicted New York murderer to be put to death in an AC-powered electric chair—a stunt designed to show how dangerous the Westinghouse standard could be.Buoyed by Westinghouse’s royalties, Tesla struck out on his own again. But Westinghouse was soon forced by his backers to renegotiate their contract, with Tesla relinquishing his royalty rights.In the 1890s Tesla invented electric oscillators, meters, improved lights and the high-voltage transformer known as the Tesla coil. He also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations of radio communication two years before Guglielmo Marconi and piloted a radio-controlled boat around a pool in Madison Square Garden. Together, Tesla and Westinghouse lit the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and partnered with General Electric to install AC generators at Niagara Falls, creating the first modern power station.Nikola Tesla’s Failures, Death and Legacy
 In 1895 Tesla’s New York lab burned, destroying years’ worth of notes and equipment. Tesla relocated to Colorado Springs for two years, returning to New York in 1900. He secured backing from financier J.P. Morgan and began building a global communications network centered on a giant tower at Wardenclyffe, on Long Island. But funds ran out and Morgan balked at Tesla’s grandiose schemes.Tesla lived his last decades in a New York hotel, working on new inventions even as his energy and mental health faded. His obsession with the number three and fastidious washing were dismissed as the eccentricities of genius.

"According to IBM, Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain. Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in our lives today. The chief difference between deep learning and machine learning is the structure of the underlying neural network architecture. “Nondeep,” traditional machine learning models use simple neural networks with one or two computational layers. Deep learning models use three or more layers—but typically hundreds or thousands of layers—to train the models. While supervised learning models require structured, labeled input data to make accurate outputs, deep learning models can use unsupervised learning. With unsupervised learning, deep learning models can extract the characteristics, features and relationships they need to make accurate outputs from raw, unstructured data. Additionally, these models can even evaluate and refine their outputs for increased precision. Deep learning is an aspect of data science that drives many applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention. This enables many everyday products and services—such as digital assistants, voice-enabled TV remotes, credit card fraud detection, self-driving cars and generative AI.

"According to Wikipedia , World War II[b] or the Second World War (1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945) was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies and the Axis powers. Nearly all the world's countries—including all the great powers—participated, with many investing all available economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities in pursuit of total war, blurring the distinction between military and civilian resources. Tanks and aircraft played major roles, with the latter enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70 to 85 million fatalities, more than half of which were civilians. Millions died in genocides, including the Holocaust of European Jews, and by massacres, starvation, and disease. Following the Allied powers' victory, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.The causes of World War II included unresolved tensions in the aftermath of World War I and the rises of fascism in Europe and militarism in Japan, and it was preceded by events including the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, Spanish Civil War, outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and German annexations of Austria and the Sudetenland. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland, after which the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany. Poland was partitioned between Germany and the Soviet Union under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, by which they had agreed on respective ""spheres of influence"" in Eastern Europe; in 1940, the Soviets annexed the Baltic states and parts of Finland and Romania. After the fall of France in June 1940, the war continued mainly between Germany and the British Empire, with fighting in the Balkans, Mediterranean, and Middle East, the aerial Battle of Britain and the Blitz, and naval Battle of the Atlantic. Through a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany took control of much of continental Europe and formed the Axis alliance with Italy, Japan, and other countries. In June 1941, Germany led the European Axis in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front and initially making large territorial gains.Japan aimed to dominate East Asia and the Asia-Pacific, and by 1937 was at war with the Republic of China. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories in Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, which resulted in the US and the UK declaring war against Japan, and the European Axis declaring war on the US. Japan conquered much of coastal China and Southeast Asia, but its advances in the Pacific were halted in mid-1942 after its defeat in the naval Battle of Midway; Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France at Normandy, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its allies westward. At the same time, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key islands. The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories; the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the fall of Berlin to Soviet troops; Hitler's suicide; and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, the US dropped the first atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of further atomic bombings, and the Soviet declaration of war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its unconditional surrender on 15 August and signed a surrender document on 2 September 1945, marking the end of the war.World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the world, and it set the foundation of international relations for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century. The United Nations was established to foster international cooperation and prevent conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US—becoming the permanent members of its security council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.","source: Historical Overview

"According to World Nuclear Association , The accident destroyed the Chernobyl 4 reactor, killing 30 operators and firemen within three months and several further deaths later. One person was killed immediately and a second died in hospital soon after as a result of injuries received. Another person is reported to have died at the time from a coronary thrombosisc. Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) was originally diagnosed in 237 people onsite and involved with the clean-up and it was later confirmed in 134 cases. Of these, 28 people died as a result of ARS within a few weeks of the accident. Nineteen more workers subsequently died between 1987 and 2004, but their deaths cannot necessarily be attributed to radiation exposured. Nobody offsite suffered from acute radiation effects although a significant, but uncertain, fraction of the thyroid cancers diagnosed since the accident in patients who were children at the time are likely to be due to intake of radioactive iodine falloutm,9. Furthermore, large areas of Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and beyond were contaminated in varying degrees. See also sections below and Chernobyl Accident Appendix 2: Health Impacts. The Chernobyl disaster was a unique event and the only accident in the history of commercial nuclear power where radiation-related fatalities occurrede. The design of the reactor is unique and in that respect the accident is thus of little relevance to the rest of the nuclear industry outside the then Eastern Bloc. However, it led to major changes in safety culture and in industry cooperation, particularly between East and West before the end of the Soviet Union. Former President Gorbachev said that the Chernobyl accident was a more important factor in the fall of the Soviet Union than Perestroika – his program of liberal reform. The Chernobyl site and plant The Chernobyl Power Complex, lying about 130 km north of Kiev, Ukraine, and about 20 km south of the border with Belarus, consisted of four nuclear reactors of the RBMK-1000 design (see information page on RBMK Reactors). Units 1 and 2 were constructed between 1970 and 1977, while units 3 and 4 of the same design were completed in 1983. Two more RBMK reactors were under construction at the site at the time of the accident. To the southeast of the plant, an artificial lake of some 22 square kilometres, situated beside the river Pripyat, a tributary of the Dniepr, was constructed to provide cooling water for the reactors. This area of Ukraine is described as Belarussian-type woodland with a low population density. About 3 km away from the reactor, in the new city, Pripyat, there were 49,000 inhabitants. The old town of Chornobyl, which had a population of 12,500, is about 15 km to the southeast of the complex. Within a 30 km radius of the power plant, the total population was between 115,000 and 135,000 at the time of the accident.","source: World Nuclear Association

"According to Oxford , A  ‘genomically’ humanized animal is generated by transfer of cloned long-stranded human genomic DNA containing genes of interest, their cis-regulatory elements, and higher-order chromatin structure (1–3). In particular, this animal can be used to elucidate the role of chromatin domains through temporal analysis including developmental processes, and spatial analysis focusing on cellular and tissue expression patterns. To clone large human genomic DNA, bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) (4), P1 phage-derived artificial chromosomes (PACs) (5) and yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) (6) have been used, and up to 900 kb genomic DNA has been successfully introduced into mice. In addition, further advancing the potential to incorporate additional genomic components, recently developed mouse artificial chromosomes (MACs) have achieved the delivery of up to 24 Mb human chromosome fragment (hCF) into mice with stable intra-individual retention and germline transmission, cumulating in generation of hCF containing animal models termed transchromosomic (TC) animals (3,7,8). These hCF-containing MACs (hCF-MACs) enabled TC animals to express human-like temporal and tissue-specific gene regulation, and are also useful for drug safety evaluation, disease mechanism studies, and pharmacological research (8,9). Due to considerable complexity associated with multiple chromosome transfers and modifications, the construction of hCF-MACs remains challenging. As an initial step, due to limited proliferation capacity, chromosome-labeled human primary cell as donor is generally transformed via fusion with mouse A9 cell to initially generate human-A9 hybrid cell (Figure 1A, steps 1 and 2) (10,11). To isolate a single human chromosome, the chromosome is required to be transferred again from the hybrid to separate A9 cell through the process termed microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) (Figure 1A, step 3) (10). MMCT is an attractive technology for cell-to-cell transfer of a microcell containing a single mammalian chromosome to a desired recipient cell (12,13). For instance, specific cell line [e.g. mouse A9, chicken DT40 or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell as a donor cell] is cultured with mitotic inhibitor colcemid to form various micronuclei encapsulating a single or small number of chromosomes (14–16). These micronuclei are further separated by centrifugation and filtration as desired microcells used for MMCT. Further complicating the process, MMCT is performed again to transfer the isolated human chromosome into DT40 cell, a well-known cell line for high proficiency in homologous recombination (HR), wherein loxP site is inserted into target region by HR (Figure 1A, steps 4 and 5) (17,18). As the last step of this lengthy procedure, the hCF is subsequently transferred into MAC-harboring CHO cell in which the hCF with loxP is translocated onto the MAC with loxP by Cre expression to construct hCF-MAC (Figure 1A, steps 6 and 7) (8,9,19). Collectively, these steps involve multiple cloning and chromosome transfer, and require proficiency in the use of specialized equipment such as high-capacity centrifuges, strict control of cell proliferation, and adeptness in cell fusion methods, all of which are compounded by low efficiency. Given the necessity for animal models that recapitulate human structural and functional dynamics at the genome level, yet the complexity associated with generating these models, we focused on three major points: (i) direct isolation of human chromosomes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) (20) as chromosome donors and bypassing the use of human-A9 hybrids, (ii) efficient micronucleation by combined treatment with paclitaxel (PTX) and reversine (Rev), instead of colcemid and (iii) CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system mediated chromosome translocation (21,22), and avoiding loxP integration in the DT40 cells and Cre-loxP recombination in the CHO cells. hiPSCs as chromosome donors possess infinite proliferation potential, but unlike cancer cells, these cells offer the intact genome with minimal occurrence of unexpected mutations, as well as the ease of chromosome labeling by genome editing and cloning (23,24). Compared with colcemid as a conventional micronucleation inducer, a combination of PTX and Rev resulted in improved micronucleation in the CHO cells (25). The microtubule destabilizer colcemid results in mitotic arrest and chromosome passive diffusion-dependent micronucleation whereas the microtubule stabilizer PTX can induce micronucleation in a mitotic arrest-independent manner (25–27). Rev inhibits mitotic checkpoints, which are part of the mechanism by which microtubule inhibitors induce cell death (28). Therefore, we attempted to further extend the applicability by testing their potential to induce direct micronucleation in hiPSCs. In addition, the recent reports indicated that CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology enabled site-specific modification of human chromosomes and MACs in the CHO cells (29). CRISPR/Cas9 has been documented to induce chromosomal translocations through simultaneous cleavage of multiple chromosomes (22,30), thereby suggesting its potential to induce site-specific cleavages and translocations in human chromosomes and MACs in the CHO cells. Here, we aimed to develop a rapid and efficient method for hCF-MAC construction by evaluating these three alternative techniques using hiPSCs as chromosome donors in MMCT, PTX and Rev as inducers of micronucleation, and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing for site-specific translocations. First, hiPSC were used for chromosome labeling with CRISPR/Cas9 and verification of PTX and Rev co-treatment induced micronucleation (Figure 1B, steps 1 and 2). Second, we attempted to transfer a model human chromosome 6 (HSA6) or 21 (HSA21) into MAC-containing CHO cell by MMCT using hiPSC donor (Figure 1B, step 2). Third, the hCF-MAC was constructed by translocation through simultaneous cleavage of MAC and human chromosome by genome editing, and cloning was performed (Figure 1B, step 3). Collectively, this simplified hCF cloning method shortens the acquisition and introduction of Mb-scaled human genomic DNA and accelerates human genome research by generating genomically humanized animals in the future.","source: Oxford

"According to Wikipedia , The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc, that started in 1947, two years after the end of World War II, and lasted until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.The term cold war is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported opposing sides in major regional conflicts, known as proxy wars.The Cold War was based on an ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their roles as the Allies of World War II that led to victory against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945.[1] Aside from the nuclear arms race and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed indirectly, such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, sports diplomacy, and technological competitions like the Space Race. The Cold War began with the announcement of the Truman Doctrine in 1947, started a gradual winding down with the Sino-Soviet split between the Soviets and the People's Republic of China in 1961, and ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.The Western Bloc was led by the United States, as well as a number of First World nations that were generally capitalist and liberal democratic but tied to a network of often authoritarian Third World states, most of which were the European powers' former colonies.[2][3] The Eastern Bloc was led by the Soviet Union and its communist party, which had an influence across the Second World and was also tied to a network of authoritarian states. The Soviet Union had a command economy and installed similarly communist regimes in its satellite states. United States involvement in regime change during the Cold War included support for anti-communist and right-wing dictatorships, governments, and uprisings across the world, while Soviet involvement in regime change included the funding of left-wing parties, wars of independence, revolutions and dictatorships around the world. As nearly all the colonial states underwent decolonization and achieved independence in the period from 1945 to 1960, many became Third World battlefields in the Cold War.","source: General historical overview

"According to Unesco , These 34 monasteries and temples, extending over more than 2 km, were dug side by side in the wall of a high basalt cliff, not far from Aurangabad, in Maharashtra. Ellora, with its uninterrupted sequence of monuments dating from A.D. 600 to 1000, brings the civilization of ancient India to life. Not only is the Ellora complex a unique artistic creation and a technological exploit but, with its sanctuaries devoted to Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, it illustrates the spirit of tolerance that was characteristic of ancient India.The invaluable ensemble of 34 caves at Ellora in the Charanandri hills of western India’s Maharashtra State showcases a spirit of co-existence and religious tolerance through the outstanding architectural activities carried out by the followers of three prominent religions: Buddhism, Brahmanism, and Jainism. The rock-cut activity was carried out in three phases from the 6th century to the 12th century. The earliest caves (caves 1–12), excavated between the 5th and 8th centuries, reflect the Mahayana philosophy of Buddhism then prevalent in this region. The Brahmanical group of caves (caves 13–29), including the renowned Kailasa temple (cave 16), was excavated between the 7th and 10th centuries. The last phase, between the 9th and 12th centuries, saw the excavation of a group of caves (caves 30–34) reflecting Jaina philosophy.Amongst the caves of the Buddhist group, Cave 10 (Visvakarma or Sutar-ki-jhopari, the Carpenter’s cave), Cave 11, and Cave 12 (Teen Tal, or three-storied monastery, the largest in this category) are particularly important. These caves mark the development of the Vajrayana form of Buddhism and represent a host of Buddhist deities. The prominent caves of the Brahmanical group are Cave 15 (Dasavatara, or Cave of Ten Incarnations), Cave 16 (Kailasa, the largest monolithic temple), Cave 21 (Ramesvara), and Cave 29 (Dumar Lena). Amongst these, Cave 16 is an excellent example of structural innovation, and marks the culmination of rock-cut architecture in India featuring elaborate workmanship and striking proportions. The temple is decorated with some of the boldest and finest sculptural compositions to be found in India. The sculpture depicting Ravana attempting to lift Mount Kailasa, the abode of Siva, is especially noteworthy. The remains of beautiful paintings belonging to different periods are preserved on the ceilings of the front mandapa (pillared hall) of this temple. The Jaina group of caves (caves 30 – 34) is exquisitely carved with fine, delicate sculptures, and includes fine paintings dedicated to the Digambara sect. Through their art and architecture, the Ellora Caves serve as a window to ancient India, including socio-cultural phenomena, material culture, politics, and lifestyles.","source: UNESCO

"According to Wikipedia , The Chola dynasty[a] (Tamil: [t͡ʃoːɻɐr]) was a Tamil dynasty originating from southern India. At its height, it ruled over the Chola Empire, an expansive maritime empire. The earliest datable references to the Chola are from inscriptions dated to the 3rd century BCE during the reign of Ashoka of the Maurya Empire. The Chola empire was at its peak and achieved imperialism under the Medieval Cholas in the mid-9th century CE. As one of the Three Crowned Kings of Tamilakam, along with the Chera and Pandya, the dynasty continued to govern over varying territories until the 13th century CE. The heartland of the Cholas was the fertile valley of the Kaveri River. They ruled a significantly larger area at the height of their power from the latter half of the 9th century till the beginning of the 13th century. They unified peninsular India south of the Tungabhadra River and held the territory as one state for three centuries between 907 and 1215 CE.[2] Under Rajaraja I and his successors Rajendra I, Rajadhiraja I, Rajendra II, Virarajendra, and Kulothunga Chola I, the empire became a military, economic and cultural powerhouse in South Asia and Southeast Asia.[3]","source: Wikipedia, name: Chola dynasty, origin: southern India, earliest references: 3rd century BCE, reign: Ashoka of the Maurya Empire, peak: mid-9th century CE, governance: till 13th century CE, heartland: Kaveri River valley, territory: unified peninsular India south of the Tungabhadra River, duration of unity: 907 to 1215 CE, rulers: Rajaraja I, Rajendra I, Rajadhiraja I, Rajendra II, Virarajendra, Kulothunga Chola I, significance: military, economic, and cultural powerhouse in South Asia and Southeast Asia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
